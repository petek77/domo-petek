#Frequently Asked Questions
<b>How to use Dashticz if Domoticz is password protected?</b><br />
Open up CONFIG.js in a text-editor (notepad for example).
Fill in the full path for Domoticz, e.g.: http://username:password@192.168.1.3:8084 (withouth trailing slash)

<b>Dashticz shows me a completely white screen!</b><br />
If you open the console-window of your webbrowser, do you see any errors about files that cannot be found?
Try adding the following code to index.html (after <head>): <base href="/DASHTICZ-FOLDER/"> 
Replace DASHTICZ-FOLDER with the exact name of the subfolder Dashticz is in...

<b>When Domoticz is updated, it has removed Dashticz?!</b><br />
Unfortunately, this occurs when Dashticz is installed into Domoticz's www-directory.
When Domoticz installs an update, it complete removes the www-directory, before placing the updated version back. Currently, there is no solution for this (except for installing Dashticz on another webserver), you have to re-install Dashticz.
